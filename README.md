Prompt:
Final Portfolio
A learning portfolio is defined as a collection of a student’s work along with learner reflections. The portfolio usually includes copies of assignments throughout a course of study that demonstrate the development or achievement of competencies – skills gained in different areas – and reflective writings for how the learner's understanding or thinking about that skill or other concepts changed through doing the work in the collected assignments. A thoughtful analysis of how these competencies will be used in future situations concludes the portfolio.

For ENGR2002, your Final Portfolio must demonstrate and explain your learning gains for each of the four course learning objectives:

Communication targeting various audiences with:
Writing that is clear, concise, cohesive, coherent, and appropriate for the audience
Presentations delivered confidently with the appropriate information, audience level, and technique
Teamwork, based on appropriate theories to recognize and build effective and efficient teams that:
Create and maintain of an inclusive working climate
Engage in dynamic, shared leadership
Demonstrate interdependence and mutual accountability
Resolve conflicts effectively
Ethical Decision-Making that applies theories and principles of engineering ethics to make data-informed decisions and considers the needs and impacts on all stakeholders by:
Identifying relevant stakeholders and their needs, interests, and/or concerns
Collecting and analyzing potentially conflicting data and viewpoints
Weighing costs and benefits to balance the health and welfare of citizens globally and locally and to preserve the health of the planet and its resources for future generations,
Making and justifying decisions
Acquiring and Applying New Knowledge is fundamental to all other objectives of the course, requiring students to:
Articulate key questions and identify the appropriate data required to answer them
Locate/obtain, summarize, and synthesize data (i.e. quantitative and qualitative; extant and unique) from reliable, valid sources
Apply the new knowledge in support of engineering decisions
Your portfolio will be submitted as a single PDF document with examples of your individual work AND examples of your personal contributions to your team's work. It is imperative when including a team assignment in your portfolio that you show and discuss your contributions to that work.

The included assignments should be organized in sections according to the course learning objectives. Each learning objective (1-4) should have at least three examples .

For concepts that are more abstract, such as "engage in dynamic, shared leadership," you would include written examples of situations where you led the team and where you followed.
You might include your original assignment submission, or the downloaded document with feedback provided by your instruction team, or both. You may provide excerpts as long as sufficient context is included.
It is fine to include assignments with evaluation at any level – "Threshold," "Fluency," or "Mastery" – especially if they show increasing competence as evidence of your development over the semester. Even a set of "Threshold" examples can be valuable as you describe challenges and your opportunities for future growth.
Be sure to document your contributions to team products through tracked changes, comments, your own preparatory documents, and/or narrative examples (stories).
If you start collecting assignments as you go along with notes to yourself about lessons you are learning, compiling it all into a single file at the end of the semester with your overarching thoughts will be much easier! 

The portfolio opens with an introduction, providing a general overview of where you started and where you are now.

In a reflective writing for each of the top-level objectives (1-4), you will explain your learning and growth by writing about the new techniques, skills, approaches, or ways of looking at your future professional responsibilities that you have learned. Each of these writings must include as evidence at least three examples from your individual or team assignments this semester.  When you use a team assignment, you must explain your intellectual contribution or how you, personally, demonstrated a skill for your team’s benefit. Use the subordinate statements for each objective as guiding concepts to examine your assignments and thinking.

Additionally, each objective’s reflection must include an explanation of how you expect to use the described knowledge/skills as an engineering professional. If you’ve changed your major, write with respect to your new path. As these are professional skills, they are applicable in other areas as well!

The reflections for each objective will be 1-2 pages long, plus the example assignments. You may need to add comments or highlights to the evidentiary assignments so that we know which part you are referring to. It is OK (for assignments longer than 2 pages even preferable!) to submit an excerpt from the document and not the entire thing -- but be sure to submit enough to clearly demonstrate your point. Cutting two sentences from a four page paper is inappropriate!

The conclusion for your portfolio will be an explanation of what you perceive to be the three most valuable lessons you have learned in the class and why they will be valuable.

Use standard ENGR2002 formatting for your portfolio. Make sure you include your name as a header. Include your assignments as an appendix at the end of each section; make sure they are labeled (e.g. Appendix A) and referred to appropriately in the text.
