                <p>Coming into this ENGR2002 Professional development class, I have had lots of practice with engineering and communication skills. However, I have not gotten a chance to practice them with college-level expectations and groups. This class proved to be very helpful.</p>

        <section id="communication" class="container">
            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <div class="wave-divider"></div>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
                <p>Communication targeting various audiences with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing that is clear, concise, cohesive, coherent, and appropriate for the audience</li>
                    <li>Presentations delivered confidently with the appropriate information, audience level, and technique</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>I communicated through online channels and in-class formatted discussions. This was new to me since I'm not used to a high level of organization within groups. For example, we had a schedule for presentation practice and communication channels for dress code planning.</p>
                
                <h3>Future Application</h3>
                <p>I can use these communication skills to more effectively email, present, and through meetings with future coworkers and bosses. Communication is a huge and underrepresented skill in engineers.</p>

        <section id="teamwork" class="container">
            <h2>Teamwork</h2>
            <div class="wave-divider"></div>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
                <p>Teamwork, based on appropriate theories to recognize and build effective and efficient teams that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and maintain an inclusive working climate</li>
                    <li>Engage in dynamic, shared leadership</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate interdependence and mutual accountability</li>
                    <li>Resolve conflicts effectively</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>I worked with many different personalities in my professional development team. Getting to know a team this deeply has not been a feature of my other work, as working together for a whole semester is fairly rare for most classes. For example, I got to know how each member responded to challenges in work.</p>
                
                <h3>Future Application</h3>
                <p>I will use the connection-building skills I learned in this class to more deeply understand future teammates and bosses. These skills proved integral to our team's success and will help me and my teams greatly in future jobs.</p>

        <section id="ethics" class="container">
            <h2>Ethical Decision-Making</h2>
            <div class="wave-divider"></div>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
                <p>Ethical Decision-Making that applies theories and principles of engineering ethics to make data-informed decisions and considers the needs and impacts on all stakeholders by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identifying relevant stakeholders and their needs, interests, and/or concerns</li>
                    <li>Collecting and analyzing potentially conflicting data and viewpoints</li>
                    <li>Weighing costs and benefits to balance health and welfare globally and locally</li>
                    <li>Making and justifying decisions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>In order to examine ethical perspectives, we went through several projects meant to help make the world a more sustainable place. This class taught me a lot about how ethics play an important part in engineering and how engineering can help lots of people. For example, we examined several perspectives on our technology, UZELA.</p>
                
                <h3>Future Application</h3>
                <p>Ethics are a huge deal with any projects I encounter. I have learned from this class how to be thorough in all of my work and examine all ethical perspectives, and this should always be paramount in any job. There is no amount of money or status that will undermine my commitment to ethical decision-making.</p>

        <section id="knowledge" class="container">
            <h2>Acquiring and Applying New Knowledge</h2>
            <div class="wave-divider"></div>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
                <p>Acquiring and Applying New Knowledge is fundamental to all other objectives of the course, requiring students to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Articulate key questions and identify the appropriate data required to answer them</li>
                    <li>Locate/obtain, summarize, and synthesize data from reliable, valid sources</li>
                    <li>Apply the new knowledge in support of engineering decisions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>Succeeding in this class required me to learn technologies and soft skills in short amounts of time. It additionally was heavily research-based, requiring me to learn lots of source-finding, annotating, and scholarly skills. For example, we learned what a strong amount of citations looks like and how to tie multiple papers into one good main idea.</p>
                
                <h3>Future Application</h3>
                <p>For any job, there will be a great deal of information-gathering required to succeed. It's important to be good and finding the correct sources of information and tying them into day-to-day life in order to become an effective member on a team.</p>
